# Pick-and-Mix Information Operators for Probabilistic ODE Solvers - Code

This repo contains the code which was used to compute the results of the paper **"Pick-and-Mix Information Operators for Probabilistic ODE Solvers"**.


---

__To solve differential equations in Julia with probabilistic numerical solvers, please use
[ProbNumDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/ProbNumDiffEq.jl)!__<br />
The code in this repository is not meant to be used as generic ODE solvers, whereas
[ProbNumDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/ProbNumDiffEq.jl)
is a Julia package under active development.
It is more stable and documented, its solvers are more efficent, and it contains more features.
The DE solvers it provides are compatible with the
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/stable/)
ecosystem.

---

A __Python__ implementation of these solvers, as well as of additional probabilistic numerical methods, is maintained in [ProbNum](https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum).
